	<p id="text_title"> SUPER MARIO WORLD </p>
	<p id="text_review"> So all in all, with its enhanced graphics, its memorable music and 
	tight controls, is Super Mario World as amazing as people say it is, 
	and is worthy of such praise after nearly 30 years? Well…..yes and no really. 
	As noted previously, the music is very memorable, the graphics do look good and
	the level design is also impressive and elegant. However, if the question was is it 
	the most definitive Mario title I would have to respectfully disagree and say that 
	Mario 64 would be the title to be the most definitive. Yes Super Mario World introduced
	Yoshi and the cape power-up that adds an exciting feature to the platforming world and 
	toe-tapping music and 96 levels (crikey – Ed). But at its core is a platforming game that
	although done well, didn’t push the boundaries that something like Mario 64 did. It isn’t a 
	question that Mario 64 had more powerful hardware or pushed Mario into 3D gaming, it just 
	brought new aspects to the table that reinvented the franchise and didn’t let it become 
	stale. The passage of time though and the hype surrounding the game in effect may be its
	own worst enemy when it comes to playing the game for the first time. Having played the
	game for a number of hours, I really wanted to love this game and share the same views 
	that countless people prior to myself have had. </p>
